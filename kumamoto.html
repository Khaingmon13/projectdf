              <p>
                Kumamoto Prefecture located in the central west of Kyushu, is a tourism
                 goldmine with Kumamoto Castle and Mt. Aso being landmarks that represent the prefecture.
                  Kumamoto Castle is perhaps one of the most impressive and most complete castles in Japan,
                   and has been a strong magnet for tourists both domestically and internationally. 
                   Its vast grounds also act as a great spot to view the cherry blossoms in Spring time.
                    For those who want to be one with nature, Mt. Aso is truly a beautiful area, 
                    with fantastic views, lush green grass, and the mountain itself still being an active volcano!
                     Amakusa and the many little islands that make up the area just south of Kumamoto city are
                      also popular scenic areas, 
                and you can even see wild dolphins swimming around if you are lucky!

            Kumamotojo Castle, designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.
             It has about 600 years of history, and is a castle deeply involved with countless
              Feudal Lords who have left their mark in history including Japan's most famous master fencer,
               "Musashi Miyamoto." It has many highlights, such as the large ginkgo trees that inspired its other name, "Ginkgo Castle," architecture called "mushagaeshi" 
            (that which turns warriors around to go back) that are said to be impossible to climb, even for ninjas!

            Okoshiki Beach
            </h3>
          <p>
            Okoshiki Beach, located in Uto City, Kumamoto Prefecture,
             is one of the most picturesque beaches in Japan famous for its beautiful mud-flats and vanishing causeway. Being a very flat beach, the patterns left by the ocean at low tide cause for an almost rippling effect on the sand which along with the sunset in the background makes for breathtaking scenery.
             So make sure you have your camera at the ready for this beautiful beach spot!

              <p>
                Nabegataki Falls is a hidden gem in Kumamoto prefecture, and just a 20 minute drive from the popular Kurokawa Onsen hot spring. What makes Nabegataki falls stick out from other waterfalls is that you can actually view the beautiful glistening curtain of water from the cave behind the waterfall. The cave itself being rather spacious and heavenly cool during the hot Japanese summer. The surrounding area and the view of the waterfall from the front is equally as beautiful as the sunshine shines through the lush green wooded area. 
                Be one with nature, and relax your body and mind at this beautiful hidden spot in Kumamoto!

                  <h3>Japan’s Number One Stone Steps </h3>
                  <p>
                    Located in Kumamoto Prefecture is Japan’s number one landmark in terms of number of stone steps, the venerable Shaka-in Temple, 
                    which is 1,200 years old. There are 3,333 steps. There is a rest area and bathroom, so you can climb while resting. The event, “Attack Japan’s Biggest,” where you finish climbing 3,333 steps at your own pace, is held in November every year. Of course, you can climb the steps outside of the event, but there are food stands, shows, a raffle and so on during the event. At the end of the climb, is it possible that you might feel a sense of accomplishment as you take in the beautiful scenery from the observatory?
※Registration is required to participate in “Attack Japan’s Number One.” Sneakers are recommended for climbing as they make it easier. `Pleases ensure you have prepared enough liquids so that you are properly hydrated.
