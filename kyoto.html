              <div class="transparent">
              <p>
                Kyoto truly is the center of traditional Japanese culture.
                 It was the seat of the Japanese Emperor from 794 until the late 19th century, 
                 when he moved to Tokyo, making the city Japan's capital for about 1100 years.
                  However, from the late 12th century, real political power in Japan was wielded 
                  by military governments or Shogunates outside of Kyoto. Nonetheless, Kyoto was
                   always significant for its cultural status and prestige. 
                   Today, it is one of Japan's most popular tourist destinations,
                    outranked perhaps only by Tokyo. This means that Kyoto can get crowded
                     during popular seasons, especially in spring and autumn. However, the beauty of many of the temples and gardens in the city is hard to beat and the density of historical places is second to none. Kyoto refers to both a city and a prefecture. When people hear Kyoto, they usually think of the city which is surrounded by mountains on three sides, including Mt. Hiei in the northeast. However, Kyoto Prefecture also includes the historical town of Uji in the south and a number of scenic locations to the north, such as Amanohashidate. Kyoto is located in between Osaka and Lake Biwa, and north of Nara. It is conveniently accessed by train, though public transportation in the city itself is less so. While somewhat hilly, especially in the north, Kyoto is a good place for getting around by bike.

          <h3>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h3>
          <p>
            Arashiyama Bamboo Grove located in the Arashiyama area of Kyoto
             is an absolute must see for any traveler to Japan. Walk through the grove of bamboo 
             trees that run for over 400m (1312ft) and feel like you're walking through a scene
              in an old samurai movie for that ultimate Japanese experience. The bamboo trees shoot up into the sky and cause for a beautiful green glow during the day from the sun creating one of the most picturesque Japanese scenery's to be seen. Or view the bamboo groove at night too,
             when it is lit up and gives a near fantasy like glow. Either way, don't forget your camera!

            Jizoin Temple
            </h3>
          <p>
            Jizoin Temple is a Buddhist temple located in the Arashiyama area of Kyoto, Japan. 
            It takes its name from its main object of worship, a statue of the bodhisattva Jizo. 
            The temple was founded in the 14th century during the Muromachi period on land that originally belonged to an influential warrior family. It is surrounded by a bamboo grove and features a garden and a Zen meditation hall. It is less famous than other temples in the area 
            and is a good spot if you are looking for an attractive but more quiet location.

              <p>
                Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine is one of the most famous Shinto Shrines in Kyoto, 
                known for its thousand red gates or torii. It is located in the Fushimi district in southern Kyoto and its main buildings are on the foot of a mountain. However, the shrine extends deep into the mountain and it is the sloping walking trails that lead through the forest and through the prominent vermillion Shinto gates that attract most international visitors. Inari is the god of rice and is associated with foxes which is why you can find fox statues throughout the area. Donating to the shrine promises good fortune, which is why many Japanese companies and individuals donate to the shrine in return for having a torii gate with their name set up on the site. As you walk through the many red and orange gates, you may see many Japanese inscriptions 
                but if you look closely you may also find some that make reference to non-Japanese donors.

                  <h3>Japan’s Number One Stone Steps </h3>
                  <p>
                    Byodoin Temple is a Buddhist temple in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture. 
                    You may have seen it before without realizing - it's pictured on the Japanese 10-yen coin. The temple belongs to the Pure Land Buddhist tradition, which holds that believers will be able to enter the Pure Land of the Buddha after death in order to break the cycle of rebirth and suffering. Byodoin Temple's stunning architecture and garden are said to be themselves representations of the Pure Land. The Phoenix Hall in the central building houses a statue of Amida Buddha. Only a limited number of people are allowed to enter the hall at any one time and there is an additional fee for admission. 
                    On the premises there is also a museum that exhibits Pure Land Buddhist art which is well worth a visit.
