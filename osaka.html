              <p>
                Osaka is the largest city in the Kansai region of Japan that also includes 
                Kyoto and Nara. It is perhaps the only city in Japan that can compete with Tokyo in terms of 
                its contribution to modern Japanese culture. Osaka is famous for its delicious and affordable food, its buzzing atmosphere and its friendly people. Osaka people also have their own dialect, Osaka-ben, which they are not afraid to use. Osaka is also the center of two types of traditional Japanese entertainment,
                 rakugo and manzai. In addition, many of Japan's most popular comedians on TV hail from Osaka.

          <h3>Tsutenkaku Tower</h3>
          <p>
            Tsutenkaku is a steel tower in the nostalgic Shinsekai area of Osaka, 
            not far from Tennoji. Despite its height of 328ft (100m) being easily outranked by
             more recent buildings, it is still well-known as a symbol of Osaka's modern history.
             Its origins go back to the early 20th century, but it was refashioned into the current 
             structure after World War Two. It was designed by
             the same architect as Tokyo Tower and shares the Paris Eiffel Tower as its inspiration.

            </h3>
          <p>
            Shitennoji Temple in Osaka is one of the Buddhist temples with the longest history in Japan. 
            It was built under the order of Prince Shotoku, one of the first promoters of Buddhism in Japan in 593. 
            It is dedicated to the four heavenly kings (shitenno) or protectors of Buddhism. The temple has been destroyed and reconstructed multiple times throughout history, but the design and architecture are said not to have changed significantly from its ancient original structure. Parts of the temple are free to enter, but the treasure house and the magnificent Gokuraku-jodo Garden (paradise garden) charge an admission fee. The contrast between the historical site and the modern surroundings, 
            and between the serene garden and the high buildings in the backdrop make for a unique Japanese atmosphere.

                  <h3>Japan’s Number One Stone Steps </h3>
                  <p>
                    Osaka Castle or Osaka-jo was built by the military commander Toyotomi Hideyoshi. 
                    Although it is located in the middle of the city, the gates and stone walls remain well-preserved 
                    and the vast grounds have become a park. The Nishinomaru Garden is a famous cherry blossom spot. 
                    You can enjoy the beautiful scenery in every season. One of the features of Osaka Castle is that huge stones are used everywhere in the castle walls. As with many other castles in Japan, the inside of the main castle tower
                     serves as a history museum. You can also enjoy a great view of Osaka from the top of the castle.
