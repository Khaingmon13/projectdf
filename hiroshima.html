              <div class="transparent">
              <p>
                Hiroshima prefecture is rich in natural beauty and history. 
                It is located in the southwest of Japan's main island, Honshu, 
                facing the Seto Inland Sea and being connected to both Shikoku and Kyushu via bridges. 
                Its most famous symbol today is perhaps the red torii gate floating in front of Miyajima
                 Island which has come to represent Japan. Internationally, Hiroshima city became famous for
                  being one of the only cities in human history to be attacked with an Atomic Bomb during World War Two.
                   This has made the city a symbol of the Japanese post-war effort for international peace. However,
                    to associate the Hiroshima region only with this incident would be to overlook its amazing regional 
                    diversity and vital culture.

          <h3>Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park</h3>
          <p>
            Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is a large park at the center of Hiroshima City, which has been built near the atomic blast site, hoping to deliver a message of world peace. Inside the park, there is a museum showing what Hiroshima was like at the time the atomic bomb was dropped, as well as various monuments and the Peace Memorial Hall. As the Peace Bells rings out with the wish for peace, 
            you can take a moment and contemplate the tragedy of war and of atomic weapons.

          <h3>Itsukushima Jinja Shrine</h3>
          <p>
            Itsukushima Shrine, a shrine in Miyajima, is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With its bold and creative structure that takes the sea as its setting, and characteristic 9th-11th century architecture, this is one of Japan's greatest shrines. When the tide comes in, one can admire the mysterious architectural beauty as the Shrine appears to float in the sea. The main shrine building (the structure where the Shinto Shrine is celebrated) which has been painted in a vivid scarlet color, is both pretty and distinctive.
             Also, the large Torii (A Traditional Japanese Shrine Gate) floating on the sea is a famous feature.

              <h3>Shukkeien Garden</h3>
              <p>
                Shukkei-en Garden was created in a royal Daimyo’s residence in 1620, and has since attracted attention because of its elegant crafted arrangements, including Japanese tea-houses, hills, rivers, and islands. The majority of the garden was destroyed in 1945 with the dropping of the atomic bomb, but it has now been restored and returned almost to its original form.
                 This is a popular spot in Hiroshima that you can enjoy in many ways.

                  <h3>Atomic Bomb Dome</h3>
                  <p>
                    A UNESCO World Heritage Site telling the modern world about the tragedy of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima City, the skeleton of the building used to be an Exhibition Hall to display various products made in Hiroshima. The building was near completely obliterated when an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima (as well as Nagasaki) during World War Two, in 1945.
                     Now, the building has become a symbol to the world of the importance of the abolition of nuclear weapons and of permanent peace; a symbol begging for "no more Hiroshimas."
