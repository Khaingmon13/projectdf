                <h3>Tokyo Tower</h3>
                <p>
                  The Tokyo Tower is a radio tower near Shiba Park in Tokyo, Japan. Constructed in 1958, it has become a symbol of Tokyo. The Tokyo Tower has a height of 333m and is one of the tallest self-standing steel constructions in the world. It was modeled after the Eiffel Tower in Paris but is actually 13m taller than the original. It used to be Japan's tallest building until it was overtaken by the Tokyo Skytree in 2012. Nonetheless, the two observation decks at the tower are still among the most popular in Tokyo and offer a great view of the city. On particularly clear days you may be able to see Mt. Fuji in the distance.

        <h3>Shibuya Crossing</h3>
          <p>
            Shibuya Crossing is Japan’s largest and most famous scramble crossing. At busy times, about 3,000 people are said to cross the intersection during one green light! Scenes of crowds of people all starting to walk at the same time when the lights change are often presented as a spectacle symbolic of the megalopolis of Tokyo, just because of the sheer numbers of pedestrians. This is so much so that Shibuya Crossing is also included in itineraries of sightseeing tours for international visitors to Japan. It is a perennially popular photo and video shoot 
            location and is close to the Hachiko exit of JR Shibuya station.
