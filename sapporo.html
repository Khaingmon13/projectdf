              <h3>Nikka Whiskey Yoichi Distillery</h3>
              <p>
                Nikka Whiskey Yoichi Distillery of Hokkaido prefecture has managed to 
                distinguish itself as a top of the line producer of whiskey by clinging to
                 its rich history and production process. Being the father of Japanese whiskey, the company's founder studied the process in Scotland for several years before bringing it back to Japan and setting up a distillery. In Hokkaido, with its rich wheat fields and brisker weather, is where he set up his own distillery which remains to this day. By continuing to use traditional Scottish techniques, like the use of coal fired pot stills, oak barrels, and old copper distilleries, 
                the Nikka brand manages to produce World-Whiskey-Award winning blended malts.

                  <p>
                    The Ao no Dokutsu Blue Cave on the Shakotan peninsula in Hokkaido is
                     a scenic spot that you can only reach by boat. The shape of the cave and the sunlight coming in at a particular angle makes the water appear in a beautiful blue tone. There are multiple cruise companies that offer boat trips to the cave between May and September as well as kayak tours for those who want to get more active.
                     Great for a day trip from Sapporo or Otaru when the weather is good.
